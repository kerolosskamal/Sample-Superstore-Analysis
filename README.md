# Sample Superstore Analysis


During my internship at Uneeq Interns. I dove into the "Sample Superstore" dataset to unearth valuable insights and trends. Hereâ€™s an overview of what I accomplished:

# Data Cleaning & Transformation:

Used Power Query to remove duplicates and ensure data integrity.

Adjusted data types for fields such as Sales, Profit, Discount, and Quantity for accurate analysis.

# Data Structuring:

Created a hierarchy encompassing Country, State, and City for streamlined navigation and analysis.

Calculated Column & Measures:

Introduced a calculated column to determine Cost (Cost = Sales - Profit).

Developed a measure for Profitability (Profitability = SUM(Profit) / SUM(Sales)).

# Data Visualizations:

## Sales Page:

KPIs: Total Sales, Total Quantities, Total Orders

Charts: Pie charts representing Sales by Category, Sales by Ship Mode, and Sales by Segment; Decomposition Tree for Sales by State and City; Funnel chart for Sales by Sub-Category
